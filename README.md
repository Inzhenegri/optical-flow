# optical-flow

This algorithm shows how to create an optical flow on a constant video stream. Optical flow, in simple terms, shows how the pixels in the stream are changing their location when the stream is moving.

## How to run?
### On a Raspberry pi
`python3 pi.py`

### On a PC
`python3 optical_flow.py` or you can `optical_flow_dense.py`
